Risk Mitigated.", outcomeText: "Your colleagues look surprised but quickly realize their mistake. They thank you, stop the conversation, and one says, 'You're right, let's take this to an office.'", feedbackText: "This is the best immediate action. You successfully mitigated a Legal/Regulatory risk by preventing a potential HIPAA breach. By being polite and direct, you protected member privacy, corrected the behavior, and reinforced KHS's culture of compliance without placing blame." }},
            { text: "Do nothing and keep walking to the breakroom.", outcome: { title: "‚ùå Risk Ignored", outcomeText: "Your colleagues continue their conversation. A member waiting for an appointment nearby looks up, having clearly overheard their discussion.", feedbackText: "While it can be uncomfortable to intervene, ignoring a potential privacy breach allows the risk to continue. This situation represents a Legal/Regulatory risk because it could lead to a HIPAA violation, which has serious consequences for both the member and KHS. A better action is to address the situation directly and discreetly." }},

This is a good step, but it wasn't the most effective one in the moment. When you can safely and politely mitigate a risk on the spot, you should." }}

You Protected the Organization.", outcomeText: "You receive an automated reply from IT thanking you for the report. A few minutes later, a company-wide alert goes out warning staff about the phishing attempt.", feedbackText: "Excellent! This is the correct procedure. You not only avoided the risk to yourself but helped protect the entire organization. Reporting threats is a critical part of your role in managing Technology risks and maintaining our cybersecurity defenses." }},

This can lead to a data breach, ransomware attacks, and significant disruption to KHS operations." }},

The IT department is unaware of this specific threat.", feedbackText: "While you protected yourself, deleting a phishing attempt without reporting it is a missed opportunity. The IT department relies on staff to report these threats so they can block the sender and warn other employees." }}

Proactive Risk Management.", outcomeText: "Your supervisor thanks you for the clear, detailed feedback. They escalate the issue to the proper department with your examples. A task force is created to fix the workflow, and you're asked to help test the solution.", feedbackText: "This is the most effective choice. Instead of complaining or creating a workaround, you took steps to fix the root cause. Identifying and communicating potential risks helps KHS manage Operational risks and improve processes." }},
            { text: "Adopt the unofficial spreadsheet because it seems faster.", outcome: { title: "‚ùå Problem Worsened", outcomeText: "The problem gets worse. With more people using the workaround, scheduling conflicts increase, and members become more frustrated. Your supervisor calls a meeting to address the high number of complaints.", feedbackText: "While it may seem efficient, creating workarounds introduces new, unmanaged Operational risks. It breaks the standard process and prevents leadership from seeing that the official system is failing." }},
            { text: "Complain about the new process to your coworkers during lunch.", outcome: { title: "‚ö†Ô∏è Ineffective Action", outcomeText: "Your coworkers agree that the process is broken, and everyone feels frustrated. However, nothing changes, and the scheduling problems continue.", feedbackText: "Sharing frustrations is understandable, but it doesn't solve the problem. To effectively manage Operational risk, concerns need to be communicated to someone who can address them." }}

They may not be able to solve it instantly, but they are now aware of the risk. They decide to raise the issue in their next leadership meeting to discuss resources.", feedbackText: "This is an excellent choice. You've acted professionally to raise a potential Human Capital risk. Bringing this to your manager's attention in a constructive way allows them to take action before more employees leave." }},
            { text: "Keep your head down and work harder to pick up the slack.", outcome: { title: "‚ùå Risk Increased", outcomeText: "You feel even more tired and stressed. The underlying workload issue remains, and now you are also at risk of burning out. The risk to the team is not resolved.", feedbackText: "While your work ethic is admirable, this response can be harmful to you and the team. It masks the severity of the workload problem, making it harder for management to recognize the Human Capital risk." }},
            { text: "Join in with coworkers who are gossiping about the resignation.", outcome: { title: "‚ö†Ô∏è Detrimental to Team Culture", outcomeText: "The team's morale sinks even lower. The environment becomes more negative and distrustful, which makes everyone's work more difficult.", feedbackText: "Participating in gossip and negative speculation actively contributes to Human Capital risk. It damages team cohesion and morale, making it more likely that other valuable employees will leave." }}

Patient Safety First.", outcomeText: "The provider checks the file, confirms it was a data entry error, and immediately corrects it. They thank you for your diligence and for preventing a potentially serious medication error.", feedbackText: "Perfect. This is the 'see something, say something' principle in action. You have helped mitigate a serious Clinical/Safety/Quality risk and protected a member from potential harm." }},

This inaction fails to mitigate a critical Clinical/Safety/Quality risk. Every team member serves as a safety check in our system." }},

You are still left with the same uncertainty, and time has been wasted. The risk has not been addressed.", feedbackText: "While collaborating is good, this is a situation that requires certainty from the source. A coworker's opinion is not a substitute for verification from the licensed provider who made the order." }}
